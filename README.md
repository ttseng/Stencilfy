Removes islands from your text to make it laser-cutter ready.

Enter your text, select a font, and export an SVG with islands automatically removed from your characters.

Counters are removed from the following characters: A,B,D,O,P,Q,R,a,b,d,e,g,o,p,q,0,4,6,8,9,&,@

A rough estimation, creating bridges at the center of the character, is used to remove counters.
